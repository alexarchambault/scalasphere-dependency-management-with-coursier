| Needed dependency management to

- Distribute an application

- Allow users to add dependencies on-the-fly in it (REPL style)

--

- conscript
--
- SBT as a library
---

:disappointed:

- conscript: degraded dependency handling of SBT
- SBT as a library: hard to re-use or do fancy things with it

- plus no parallel downloads, poor progress reporting, ...
--

- dependency resolution not that big a deal,
  no need to go hoops and loops for that

- very-very core: resolution
    ~500 SLOC (its first versions)
    written a bit in anger mid 2015

- remaining: mid 2015
             significant additions end of 2015

- API: mainly a bunch of case classes / ADTs,
       along with monad-wrapped IO
